# Unique-Integers-in-Sorted-Lists

Okay this one's gonna be my last for the day. I've run into the same "Time Limit Exceeded" problem again but I'm sure I'll figure out a way.

***Question: Given a list of sorted integers nums return the number of unique integers in the list.***


The question also mentions that O(n) is accepted but O(k log n) is encouraged. Dunno what that means lolll.

Anywho as of now I'll be uploading my solution that works for smaller lists.
